### Fixed

## [1.1.0] - 2021-07-04
Last minute changes for T2K.

### Changed
- Updated `infos.hbs` template with correct T2K weapon-related infos.

### Added
- New getters for the `YearZeroRoll`, mostly used by T2K:
  - `.jamCount`: The quantity of ones (banes) on base dice and ammo dice.
  - `.jammed`: Tells if the roll caused a weapon jam.
- Missing locked values for Ammo dice.
- Setting the global "`CONFIG.debug.dice = true`" will log the roll objects in the console.

### Removed
- The two getters previously added. They were useless in fact:
  - `YearZeroRoll.baseBaneCount`
  - `YearZeroRoll.ammoBaneCount`

### Fixed
- `YearZeroRoll.ammoSpent` is now correctly returning the sum of the active values on ammo dice.
- Modifiers for T2K rolls now properly work as detailed in the rules.

### Deprecated
- `YearZeroRoll.mishap` is deprecated (useless for now).
